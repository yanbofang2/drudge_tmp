class GenQuadLatticeDrudge(GenQuadDrudge):
    r"""Drudge for general quadratic algebra with concentration on the bases.

    The name of this drudge class can be slightly misleading.  This class is
    designed for algebraic systems where the generators can optionally be
    indexed by indices called the lattice indices.  Generators at different
    lattice sites are commutative, and the normal-ordering and commutation for
    generators with the same lattice index are solely determined by the base.

    Parameters
    ----------

    ctx
        The spark context.

    order
        An iterable giving the order of the vector bases in the normal order.
        Earlier vectors will be attempted to be put into earlier positions.

    comms
        The commutators, given as a mapping with keys being pairs of vector
        bases.  The values should give information about the commutation, which
        can be anything interpretable as a sum of terms giving the value of the
        commutator, or it can also be a pair with the second entry giving the
        phase of the commutation, which by default is unity.  For an entry::

            (a, b): (kappa, phi)

        we got the commutation rule

        .. math::

            [a, b] = \phi b a + \kappa

        The phase has to be a scalar quantity.  When the vectors inside the
        commutator have no index, they are going to be indexed by the indices
        from the vectors being commuted during the normal-ordering operation.

        When the commutation rules depends on the indices of the operators, the
        key can be vectors with plain Symbol indices, with the commutator given
        in terms of them.  Note that this does not change the semantics of
        lattice algebra, different generators with different lattice indices
        always commute.  So the indices of the pair of vectors must match
        exactly.  When general commutation and specialized commutation are both
        present, the specialized takes precedence.

    assume_comm

        If vectors with their commutator unspecified be assumed to be
        commutative. It is false by default.

    kwargs
        All the rest of the parameters are given to be base class.
