            simplifiable, the simplified SymPy expression should be returned.
            Note that, currently, the simplified form cannot be a Sum by itself.

            By default, it is set to True, which will use the

        excl_bases

        When the given LHS is a plain SymPy symbol, all its appearances in the
        amplitude of the tensor will be replaced.  Or the LHS can also be
        indexed SymPy expression or indexed Vector, for which all of the
        appearances of the indexed base or vector base will be attempted to be
        matched against the indices on the LHS.  When a matching succeeds for
        all the indices, the RHS, with the substitution found in the matching
        performed, will be replace the indexed base in the amplitude, or the
        vector.  Note that for scalar LHS, the RHS must contain no vector.  For
        vector LHS, also supported is a product of vectors.  This will lead to
        pattern matching inside the vector part.

        A special case is when the LHS is a plain integral unity.  In this case,
        the scalar terms will be replaced by product with the RHS, as if the
        identity element has been replaced by the RHS.

        Parameters
        ----------

        lhs
            The left-hand side of the substitution.

        rhs
            The right-hand side of the substituion.

        wilds
            Since we do not commonly define tensors with wild symbols, an option
            ``wilds`` can be used to give a mapping translating plain symbols on
            the LHS and the RHS to the wild symbols that would like to be used.
            The default value of None could make all **plain** symbols in the
            indices of the LHS to be translated into a wild symbol with the same
            name and no exclusion. And empty dictionary can be used to disable
            all such automatic translation.  The default value of None should
            satisfy most needs.

        full_balance
            If load-balancing is going to be performed after each substitution
            step.  This is normally not needed.

        excl
            Symbols that needs to be excluded to be used as dummies.

        simult
            The core substitution algorithm works by making one substitution at
            a time until no more left-hand side can be matched successfully.  In
            this way, if the pattern in the LHS reappears on the RHS, infinite
            loop will be resulted.  When it is set to true, the
            newly-substituted part will no longer participate in the matching.

            By default, it is true.  Internally, it decorates the free variables
            on the RHS to special forms, so that the originally-present ones are
            different from the newly-substituted ones.  Note that its disabling
            makes sense only when the LHS is a complex pattern.

        Examples
        --------

        For instance, we can have a very simple tensor, the outer product of the
        same vector,

        .. doctest::

            >>> dr = Drudge(SparkContext())
            >>> r = Range('R')
            >>> a, b = dr.set_dumms(r, symbols('a b c d e f'))[:2]
            >>> dr.add_default_resolver(r)
            >>> x = IndexedBase('x')
            >>> v = Vec('v')
            >>> tensor = dr.einst(x[a] * x[b] * v[a] * v[b])
            >>> str(tensor)
            'sum_{a, b} x[a]*x[b] * v[a] * v[b]'

        We can replace the indexed base by the product of a matrix with another
        indexed base,

        .. doctest::

            >>> o = IndexedBase('o')
            >>> y = IndexedBase('y')
            >>> res = tensor.subst(x[a], dr.einst(o[a, b] * y[b]))
            >>> str(res)
            'sum_{a, b, c, d} y[c]*y[d]*o[a, c]*o[b, d] * v[a] * v[b]'

        We can also make substitution on the vectors,

        .. doctest::

            >>> w = Vec('w')
            >>> res = tensor.subst(v[a], dr.einst(o[a, b] * w[b]))
            >>> str(res)
            'sum_{a, b, c, d} x[a]*x[b]*o[a, c]*o[b, d] * w[c] * w[d]'

        After the substitution, we can always make a simplification, at least to
        make the naming of the dummies more aesthetically pleasing,

        .. doctest::

            >>> res = res.simplify()
            >>> str(res)
            'sum_{a, b, c, d} x[c]*x[d]*o[c, a]*o[d, b] * w[a] * w[b]'

    can be construed as a tensor.  By storing it as a :py:class:`Tensor`
    object, we can mathematically manipulate it.  With an explicit left-hand
    side,

    .. math::

        t_j = \\sum_j o_{i, j} f_j

    is now a tensor definition, which can be handled by the current class.

    A tensor definition is a subclass of tensor.  With explicit storage of a
    left-hand side, it can be convenient to be used for :py:meth:`Tensor.subst`
    or :py:meth:`Tensor.subst_all` method, or it can be directly indexed.  For
    example, with the above definition stored in ``t_def``, for tensor ``v``
    holding :math:`\\sum_j u_{i, j} t_j`,

    ::

        v.subst(t_def.lhs, t_def.rhs)

    or ::

        v.subst_all([t_def])

    or, with the :py:meth:`act` method, ::

        t_def.act(v)

    we can get

    .. math::

        \\sum_{j, k} u_{i, j} o_{j, k} f_k

    Tensor definition can also be directly subscripts, like ``t_def[1]``
    gives :math:`sum_i o_{1, i} f_i`.

    Being a subclass of :py:class:`Tensor`, :py:class:`TensorDef` supports all
    tensor manipulations, albeit the result will not be a tensor definition
    automatically.

        This is the core function for creating tensors from scratch.  The
        arguments should start with the summations, each of which should be
        given as a sequence, normally a tuple, starting with a SymPy symbol for
        the summation dummy in the first entry.  Then comes possibly multiple
        domains that the dummy is going to be summed over, which can be symbolic
        range, SymPy expression, or iterable over them.  When symbolic ranges
        are given as :py:class:`Range` objects, the given dummy will be set to
        be summed over the ranges symbolically.  When SymPy expressions are
        given, the given values will substitute all appearances of the dummy in
        the summand.  When we have multiple summations, terms in the result are
        generated from the Cartesian product of them.

        The last argument should give the actual thing to be summed, which can
        be something that can be interpreted as a collection of terms, or a
        callable that is going to return the summand when given a dictionary
        giving the action on each of the dummies.  The dictionary has an entry
        for all the dummies.  Dummies summed over symbolic ranges will have the
        actual range as its value, or the actual SymPy expression when it is
        given a concrete range.  In the returned summand, if dummies still
        exist, they are going to be treated in the same way as statically-given
        summands.

        The predicate can be a callable going to return a boolean when called
        with same dictionary.  False values can be used the skip some terms.  It
        is guaranteed that the same dictionary will be used for both predicate
        and the summand when they are given as callables.

        For instance, mostly commonly, we can create a tensor by having simple
        summations over symbolic ranges,

        .. doctest::

            >>> dr = Drudge(SparkContext())
            >>> r = Range('R')
            >>> a = Symbol('a')
            >>> b = Symbol('b')
            >>> x = IndexedBase('x')
            >>> v = Vec('v')
            >>> tensor = dr.sum((a, r), (b, r), x[a, b] * v[a] * v[b])
            >>> str(tensor)
            'sum_{a, b} x[a, b] * v[a] * v[b]'

        And we can also give multiple symbolic ranges for a single dummy to sum
        over all of them,

        .. doctest::

            >>> s = Range('S')
            >>> tensor = dr.sum((a, r, s), x[a] * v[a])
            >>> print(str(tensor))
            sum_{a} x[a] * v[a]
             + sum_{a} x[a] * v[a]

        When the objects to sum over are not symbolic ranges, we are in the
        concrete summation mode, for instance,

        .. doctest::

            >>> tensor = dr.sum((a, 1, 2), x[a] * v[a])
            >>> print(str(tensor))
            x[1] * v[1]
             + x[2] * v[2]

        The concrete and symbolic summation mode can be put together freely in
        the same summation,

        .. doctest::

            >>> tensor = dr.sum((a, r, s), (b, 1, 2), x[b, a] * v[a])
            >>> print(str(tensor))
            sum_{a} x[1, a] * v[a]
             + sum_{a} x[2, a] * v[a]
             + sum_{a} x[1, a] * v[a]
             + sum_{a} x[2, a] * v[a]

        Note that this function can also be called on existing tensor objects
        with the same semantics on the terms.  Existing summations are not
        touched by it.  For instance,

        .. doctest::

            >>> tensor = dr.sum(x[a] * v[a])
            >>> str(tensor)
            'x[a] * v[a]'
            >>> tensor = dr.sum((a, r), tensor)
            >>> str(tensor)
            'sum_{a} x[a] * v[a]'

        where we have used summation with only summand (no sums) to create
        simple tensor of only one term without any summation.

        to be recognized as a summation, it must appear twice or more in its

        will be considered to be for non-conventional purposes and will no

        Parameters
        ==========

        inp

            The input tensor or tensor definition.

        sep_lines

            If terms should be put into separate lines by separating them with
            ``\\``.

        align_terms

            If ``&`` is going to be prepended to each term to have them aligned.
            This option is intended for cases where the LaTeX form is going to
            be put inside environments supporting alignment.

        proc

            A callable to be called with the string of the original LaTeX
            formatting of each of the terms to return a processed final form.
            The callable is also going to be given keyword arguments ``term``
            for the actual tensor term and ``idx`` for the index of the term
            within the tensor.

        no_sum : bool

            If summation is going to be suppressed in the printing, useful for
            cases where a convention, like the Einstein's, exists for the
            summations.

        bounds : bool

            If the bounds of summations should be printed when they are
            explicitly present.

        scalar_mul : str

            The text for scalar multiplication.  By default, scalar
            multiplication is just rendered as juxtaposition.  When a string is
            given for this argument, it is going to be placed between scalar
            factors and between the amplitude and the vectors.  In LaTeX output
            of tensors with terms with many factors, special command
            ``\invismult`` can be used, which just makes a small space but
            enables the factors to be automatically split by the ``breqn``
            package.  Note that this option has effect only for expanded terms,
            where the scalar multiplication occurs on the top-level.

        with Python.

        Being a Python script executed inside the current interpreter,
        drudge script differs from normal Python scripts by

        1. All integer literal are resolved into SymPy symbolic integers.

        2. Global names are resolved in the order of,

           - the name archive in the current drudge,
           - the special drudge script functions in the drudge,
           - the drudge package exported names,
           - the gristmill package exported names (if installed),
           - the SymPy exported names,
           - built-in Python names.

        3. All unresolved names are created as a special kind of symbolic
           object, which behaves basically like SymPy ``Symbol``, but with
           differences,

           1. They are be directly subscripted, like ``IndexedBase``.

           2. ``def_as`` method can be used to make a tensor definition with
              such symbols or its indexing on the left-hand side, the other
              operand on its right-hand side.  The resulted definition is also
              added to the name archive of the drudge.

           3. ``<=`` operator can be used similar to ``def_as``, except the
              definition is not added to the archive.  The result can be put
              into local variables.

        4. All left-shift augmented assignment ``<<=`` operations are
           replaced by ``def_as`` method calling.

        5. Some operations could have slightly different behaviour more suitable
           inside drudge scripts.  For developers, the :py:meth:`inside_drs`
           property can be used to query if the function is called inside a
           drudge script.

        Parameters
        ----------

        defs
            An iterable giving all the definitions.  No vector should be
            redefined and non-vector definitions will be construed as definition
            of unity.

        rhs_vecs
            The vectors on the right-hand side.  When it is given as None, all
            vectors appearing in the RHSes of the definitions will be ordered in
            an non-deterministic way.

        ret_rhs
            If the actual list of RHS vectors is going to be returned.
