<h1 align="center">Drudge</h1>

Drudge is a symbolic algebra system built on top of
[SymPy](http://www.sympy.org), focusing primarily on tensorial and
noncommutative algebras. It is motivated by tedious symbolic derivations in
quantum chemistry and many-body theory but is also useful for any symbolic
manipulation and simplification involving indexed quantities, symbolic
summations, and noncommutative algebras.

Leveraging the generic algorithms implemented in
[libcanon](https://github.com/DrudgeCAS/libcanon) for canonicalization of
combinatorial objects, such as strings and graphs, Drudge can find canonical
forms for mathematical expressions involving tensors with symmetries and
symbolic summations. For example, considering a fourth-order tensor $u$
satisfying

$$
u_{abcd} = -u_{bacd} = -u_{abdc} = u_{badc},
$$

an expression like

$$
\sum_{cd} u_{acbd} \rho_{dc} - \sum_{cd} u_{cabd} \rho_{dc} + \sum_{cd} u_{cdbc} \rho_{cd}
$$

can be automatically simplified to a single term,

$$
3 \sum_{cd} u_{acbd} \rho_{dc},
$$

irrespective of the names and ordering of the summation indices.

In addition to fully considering the permutational symmetries of tensors and
summations, Drudge provides a general framework for handling noncommutative
algebraic systems. Currently, Drudge natively supports the [canonical
commutation relations (CCR) and canonical anticommutation relations (CAR)
algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCR_and_CAR_algebras) for fermions and
bosons, respectively, in many-body theory, general [Clifford
algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra), and the [su(2)
algebra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_unitary_group#Lie_Algebra) in
its Cartan-Killing basis. Other noncommutative algebraic systems can be added
with ease.

Using symbolic expressions from Drudge, the companion package
[gristmill](https://github.com/DrudgeCAS/gristmill) can automatically optimize
and generate numerical code. Optimal computational complexity can be achieved
for various methods in quantum chemistry, which heavily rely on tensor
contractions and their sums.
