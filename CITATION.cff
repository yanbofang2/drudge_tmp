title: "Drudge: A symbolic algebra system for tensorial and noncommutative algebras"
type: software
repository-code: "https://github.com/DrudgeCAS/drudge"
abstract: "Drudge is a symbolic algebra system built on top of SymPy, focusing primarily on tensorial and noncommutative algebras. It is motivated by tedious symbolic derivations in quantum chemistry and many-body theory but is also useful for any symbolic manipulation and simplification involving indexed quantities, symbolic summations, and noncommutative algebras."
